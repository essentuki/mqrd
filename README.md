Make Your Day a Good Day! - To-Do List for a Terminal

Current version: 1.0

A program for those who love the terminal and the efficiency of doing everything from their keyboard.

This first attempt was using Python and Procedural Oriented Programming. 

Created Features:
- Add an element in automatic mode
- Edit an element
- Delete an element
- Check an element as done
- Postpone an element for next day
- Start Pomodoro with a defined time
- Exit the program
- After exiting, if open again, it recovers the pending day's task
- Is possible to recover the undone tasks of the previous day
- It creates a log file, with all changes occurring during a day

The second attempt will consist in replicating it with Classes (OOP).
