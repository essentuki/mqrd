# MQRD
Make Your Day a Good Day! - To-Do List for a Terminal

Current version: 1.1

A program for those who love the terminal and the efficiency of doing everything from their keyboard.

Why MQRD? It's a funny way to shorten the expression Make Your Day. 

                  (M)-a-(KeYou)-(RD)-ay = MQRD 

Reminding ourselves that we are responsible for anything that happens on our day.

This first attempt was using Python and Procedural Oriented Programming. 

Created Features:
- Add an element in automatic mode
- Edit an element
- Delete an element
- Check an element as done
- Postpone an element for next day
- Start Pomodoro with a defined time
- Exit the program
- After exiting, if open again, it automatically recovers the pending day's tasks
- It is possible to recover the undone tasks of the previous day
- It creates a file, with all changes occurring during a day

The second attempt will consist in replicating it with Classes (OOP).

INSTALLATION:
To properly run the program your system requires you to install the following python packages.

     pip install playsound pytimedinput
